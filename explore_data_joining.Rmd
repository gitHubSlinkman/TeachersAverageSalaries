# Objective of this document

The Rmarkdown files explores the joining of the teacher salary data by state with the cost of living by state.

## Set up R for analysis

```{r}
require( tidyverse )                     # I live in the tidyverse.
require( here )                          # To simplify directory access.
this_here <- here()                      # Find projecxt directory location.
```

## Read the techer salary data

```{r}
source <- file.path( this_here,
                     "data",
                    "TeacherSalaries2022.csv")
Salaries <- read_csv( source ) %>% 
              arrange( state )
dim( Salaries )
Salaries
```

## Read cost of living data

```{r}
source <- file.path( this_here,
                     "data",
                    "COLA.csv")
Cola <- read_csv( source ) %>% 
          select( state, cola ) %>% 
              arrange( state )
          
dim( Cola )
Cola
```

## Join the two files by state name

```{r}
Adjusted <-
  inner_join( Salaries, 
              Cola,
              by = "state" )
    
Adjusted <- 
  Adjusted %>%
    mutate( adjustedTeacherPay = teacherPay / ( cola / 100 ))
          
Adjusted <-
  Adjusted %>% 
    mutate( adjustedTeacherPay / (cola / 100))

dim( Adjusted )
Adjusted

```
